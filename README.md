# expression-evaluator
A library that lets you bind string names to your functions and parse expressions that try to call these functions at runtime.
This library takes advantage of template meta-programming, variadic generics, and polymorphic types to make it incredibly easy to bind functions with names, and store arbitrary types in a powerful variable system.
It can also be used simply for creating and manipulating expression trees for algebra or lambda calculus.
