minimal_example.cpp is used here but you can build any of the examples with these commands

generally: 
building requires only a c++ compiler that supports c++17, runtime type info, and exceptions.
the project is header only, so you dont need to build any thing outside of your own project.

specifically:

g++ minimal_example.cpp -std=c++17
or
clang-cl minimal_example.cpp /GX /std:c++17
or
clang++ minimal_example.cpp -std=c++17
or
open msvc, create a project, set the language standard to c++17, add an existing file, and select minimal_example.cpp

caveats:

for msvc, cpp files may need to be set with "bigobj" in their properties.
on windows g++ might need -Os to optimize for size
on windows clang++ may need "-Xclang -flto-visibility-public-std"

notes:

clang-cl needs "/GX" to enable exceptions
clang++ needs "-Xclang -flto-visibility-public-std" to enable runtime type info
using "Wall" with clang-cl may result in warnings, but "Wmany" should not
using "Weverything" with clang++ may result in warnings, but "Wall" should not
using "Wall" with g++ should not result in warnings

the only important folders in this repository are implementation and include.
they can be coppied and moved anywhere. everything else can be deleted if it isn't needed.
