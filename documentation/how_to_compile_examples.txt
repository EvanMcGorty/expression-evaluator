minimal_example.cpp is used here but you can build any of the examples with these commands

g++ minimal_example.cpp -std=c++17
or
clang-cl minimal_example.cpp /GX /std:c++17
or
clang++ minimal_example.cpp -std=c++17 -Xclang -flto-visibility-public-std

for msvc, cpp files may need to be set with "bigobj" in their properties.
of course, you also must turn on c++17 for msvc.


clang-cl needs /GX to enable exceptions
clang++ needs -Xclang -flto-visibility-public-std

on windows g++ might need -Os to optimize for size

requires c++17 support, runtime type info, and exceptions.
