my theorem solver is an example of how one might use this library only for it's expressions 
(to take advantage of their tree-like structure)
it requires mathematical expressions that to be iterated through.
as it uses the expression-evaluator as a submodule, you can clone it with:

git clone https://github.com/EvanMcGorty/theorem-solver.git --recurse-submodules

inlcude run.h and call run() to see it in action
