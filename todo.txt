make evaluation completely unrelated to expressions so expression-like tasks can still be done 
without overhead (so you can still do algebra with trees of nodes and you can evaluate lambda 
calculus expressions).

make multiple ways to create an any_caller (e.g. from a function that takes a vector of value_holder*)

allow any derived class to be passed as an argument for a base class

give expressions access to garbage values

wrap everything up nicely
