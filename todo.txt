make the library for elem more complicated and provide functions for making algebraic operations convenient

make it so an elem can contain enums that corrospond to names.

make some sort of overload-resolution system

organize environment class
make data members of environment private, give it function binding member functions
get rid of (at least most) macros

allow any derived class to be passed as an argument for a base class
possibly by generating a lookup function that takes a typeid and calls a generic lambda with its type

allow classes to be passed into types that they are implicitly convertable to

add static asserts to avoid cryptic error messages from bad function signatures

try returning const t as a const t* (because in some sense it is a const t&&)
possibly by making a derived class from object_of that looks like:
{
    x(t&& b) : a(b) {}
    t& a;    
};

use fancy exceptions instead of runtime asserts to give more clear error messages to the user of the library

test, test, test!
