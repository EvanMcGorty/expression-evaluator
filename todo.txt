make the library for elem more complicated and provide functions for making algebraic operations convenient

make it so an elem can contain enums that corrospond to names.


add static asserts to avoid cryptic error messages from bad function signatures
use fancy exceptions instead of runtime assertions to give more clear error messages to the user of the library


add more function signature types than just callable and manual (maybe one that accepts only optionals and returns an optional or something like that)


make scripting utilities, error messages for failed calls, ability to add default operations for the last value left on the stack

in addition to parsing of a string into a class, add methods for getting a view string for a class.


optimize, get rid of extra copy construction, etc.


make sure mutable and volitile values work


test, test, test!
try testing by making an algebra library, a matrix library
test it with simple board games
